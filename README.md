# Finance_tracker
This Python project is a simple yet powerful finance tracker that allows users to manage and visualize their financial transactions. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it user-friendly and easy to interact with.

Features

Add financial transactions (both income and expenses) by specifying the date, amount, category, and a description.
Automatically handles CSV file creation and appends new data to maintain a running history of transactions.

View Transactions:

Filter and view transactions within a specific date range.
Provides a summary that includes the total income, total expenses, and net savings for the selected period.
Optionally plot the data to visualize income and expenses over time using Matplotlib.

Data Storage:

Transactions are stored in a CSV file (finance_data.csv), ensuring that your data is easily accessible and portable.
The CSV file is automatically created and initialized if it doesn't exist.
